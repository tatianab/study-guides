Quarter   : Winter 2016  

### Basic Definitions

##### Some basic security goals
* Prevention.
* Detection.
* Reaction.

##### Security services
* Confidentiality : no unauthorized information disclosed.
* Integrity : no unauthorized modification.
* Availability : information/resources cannot be withheld.
* Authenticity : no unauthorized modification of information **origin.**
* Accountability : history/logs cannot be modified, actions can be linked to
  entities.
* Reliability : continued operation after failure (accidental or malicious).
* Safety : limit impact of failures on environment.

##### Types of security
* Computer Security : protect data and resources
* Network Security : protect data during transmission
* Internet Security : protect data during transmission over a collection of 
  heterogeneous interconnected networks.

##### Security attack types
* Passive : eavesdropping
* Active  : modification of data, denial of service, replay

### Network Threats and Attacks

#### Internet Structure

**TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**  
Sender breaks data into segments, a sequence
number is attached to every packet.  
Receiver reassembles the segments and sends
an acknowledgement for packets.  
A connection state is maintained by both.

**TCP Handshake**
```
Client			Server
-----------------------
				 Listening...
      --------->  
      	SYN_c	 Spawn thread, store data.

     <---------- 
     SYN_s, ACK_c
                  Wait...
      ---------->
        ACK_s     Connected.
```

**IP (Internet Protocol)**  
IP is a connectionless, unreliable, "best-effort"
protocol.
Addresses (and address prefixes) are used for routing.

| IP Packet  |
| ---------- |
| Source     |
| Dest       |
| Sequence # |

**IP Routing**

**BGP**  
For route discovery.

**ICMP (Control Message Protocol)**  
Provides feedback about network operation.

**UDP**

**DNS (Domain Name System)**  
For IP address discovery.

#### Attacks and Solutions

**Packet Sniffing**  
Snoop on connection; read unencrypted data.

**"Smurf" Attack**  
DoS attack.  
Attacker broadcasts an ICMP Echo Request ("are you alive?"), with the source set to the victim's IP address.  
Every host replies to the victim; flood of replies overwhelms victim.
Solution: Reject external packets to broadcast addresses.  

**"Ping of Death"**
Programming error in old Windows causes machine to
crash when it receives an ICMP packet with payload
over 64k.

**"Teardrop" and "Bonk"**
Attacker modifies offset of TCP packets to: overlapping values OR very large value. Bad implementation of TCP/IP crashes with these ill-formed offsets.

**"LAND"**  
Single packet DoS.
IP packet with src = dst, and SYN flag set.
Goes into infinite loop!

**SYN Flooding**
Attacker sends many SYN's from different (spoofed) client addresses.
Server (victim) spawns many new threads but never hears back from any of them.  
Eventually, server has no more resources and must deny legitimate requests.

General problem: **asymmetry** allows attacker to do minimal work and victim must respond with hard work.

Solutions:
- **SYN Cookies** : TODO
- **Random Deletion** : If SYN queue full, simply delete any random entry. Possible for real user to be denied, but they will try again. Eventually all malicious entries will be deleted.

**TCP Connection Spoofing**  
TCP connections have state : sequence number, port number. This state is easy to guess because port numbers are standard and sequence numbers are predictable.

Why? Because if attacker knows first number and roughly how much traffic has been sent so far, he can guess a sequence number. There is tolerance for a range of sequence numbers to handle packet loss.

**Blind IP Spoofing**

**DoS by Connection Reset**

**BGP Security Issues**

**DNS Spoofing**

**Reverse DNS Spoofing**

**Pharming**

**JavaScript/DNA Intranet Attack**

**Domain Hijacking**

#### Countermeasures

**DNS Spoofing Resolution**

**DNSSEC**

### Firewalls
Firewalls are meant to protect an internal network from the "big bad" internet.

**Firewall Types**
- Packet or session-filtering router (filters)
- Proxy gateway (application-level or circuit-level)
- Personal firewall

**Packet Filtering**  
Firewall makes a per-packet decision as to whether the packet is OK. Can be based on any information about the packet (e.g., IP src/dest, port, protocol, TCP flags, ICMP message type).

Rules are based on pattern matching.

FTP - TODO

Weaknesses - TODO

**Fragmentation Attacks**

**Session Filtering**  
Decisions are made on a per-packet basis, in the wider context of a connection.  
(Can be bypassed with **IP tunneling**).

**Circuit-level Gateway**

**Application-level Gateway**

**Filtering Outbound Connections**

**Bastion Host Idea**

**General problems**
